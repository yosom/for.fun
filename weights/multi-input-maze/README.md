Originally just an idea and excuse to test the gamepad API ðŸŽ®, this spiraled out of control a little into a multi-input maze. You can navigate trough the maze, depending on your browser/os, by:
- clicking the up/down/left/rigt-buttons
- the arrow keys on your keyboard
- the WASD-keys on your keyboard if that is more your style
- by scrolling up/down or left/right
- by swiping if your device of choice has a touchscreen
- by tilting your device
- by typing up(), down(), left() or right() in the console
- and finally by using a compatible gmepad, aka the original idea ðŸ™ƒ

The maze is randomly generated using the "recursive backtracking algorithm.
