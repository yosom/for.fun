 Really liked Leon's idea about a simple widget that shows some info about Today: the weather, uncompleted tasks and when for example your bus departs.

As i wanted to improve it a bit, i've added the back of the widget: Wunderlist sync and some inputs for setting your Location and Alarm.

Also, i've taken my time to code it.

Check out the @2x and leave some feedback !
