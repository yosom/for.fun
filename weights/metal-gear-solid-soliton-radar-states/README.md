# Metal Gear Solid Soliton Radar States

A Pen created on CodePen.

Original URL: [https://codepen.io/yexx/pen/pvJvQLZ](https://codepen.io/yexx/pen/pvJvQLZ).

A representation of the Soliton Radar states made only with HTML and CSS. Using animation for the counters and the gibberish text that appears.
SVG filters for the noise, and clip-path for the interference.

I will optimize this code someday

Fonts used:
- Tiny5 (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Tiny5) for the titles
- DotGothic16 (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/DotGothic16) for the Kanjis
- FlowBlock (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Flow+Block) for the lines gibberish text
- Digital 7 Mono (https://www.cdnfonts.com/digital-7-mono.font) for the timer
