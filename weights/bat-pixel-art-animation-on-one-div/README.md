Exploring pixel art through a CSS box-shadow experiment. Feel free to tweak SCSS variables for color, size, and animation speed. Note: Using the box-shadow hack in a production environment is not recommended. For optimal results, consider using a GIF image, data URI, or SVG. This pen is a personal endeavor aimed at having fun, acquiring new insights, and refining my skills.
